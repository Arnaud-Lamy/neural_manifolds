# neural_manifolds
Some of the code for my project in ELEN 6876: Sparse and Low-Dimensional Structures in High-Dimensional Data. I explore whether a particular experiment in the mc-1 dataset (https://crcns.org/data-sets/motor-cortex/mc-1) has a manifold structure through visualizations and scree plots.
